2、消息缓存机制，确保长轮询工作模式下不丢失消息\r\n      2、客户端或服务端一方断线、异常，另一方能立即感知\r\n      2、基于纯异步事件模型提供编程，支持onOpen、onClose、onError、onMessage事件\r\n      3、允许客户端主动断开链接\r\n      4、当采用websocket或者XMLHttpRequest 2时才支持流传输，XMLHttpRequest 1不支持流\r\n         另外，当采用XMLHttpRequest（1或2）时，因HTTP 1.1协议限制客户端同时持有的长链接数，导致会有一定使用限制\r\n      5、浏览器支持情况以及使用的实现方案如下：\r\n        Websocket: 基于HTML5之后出现的新协议 websocket\r\n

[2017-07-25]\r\n  特性介绍：\r\n      1、通过实现方案自动切换，支持目前所有浏览器\r\n      2、独立小巧，不依赖于第三方包\r\n      2、支持通道特性，默认channel=Biz，channel=Monitor为监控通道\r\n      2、支持消息按类型监听，供不同业务类别使用\r\n      2、消息缓存机制，确保长轮询工作模式下不丢失消息\r\n      2、客户端或服务端一方断线、异常，另一方能立即感知\r\n      2、基于纯异步事件模型提供编程，支持onOpen、onClose、onError、onMessage事件\r\n      3、允许客户端主动断开链接\r\n      4、当采用websocket或者XMLHttpRequest 2时才支持流传输，XMLHttpRequest 1不支持流\r\n         另外，当采用XMLHttpRequest（1或2）时，因HTTP 1.1协议限制客户端同时持有的长链接数，导致会有一定使用限制\r\n      5、浏览器支持情况以及使用的实现方案如下：\r\n        Websocket: 基于HTML5之后出现的新协议 websocket\r\n        Stream：基于HTML5之后出现的XMLHTTPRequest 2 才支持流传输\r\n        lpool：基于XMLHTTPRequest（1）支持的异步文本传输请求\r\n         |—————————|——————|—————|————|——————|\r\n         |      浏览器      |  Websocket |  Stream  |  Lpool
